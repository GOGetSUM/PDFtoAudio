"Father to a murdered son. Husband to a murdered wife.”

My name is Maximus Decimus Meridius, commander of the Armies of
the North, General of the Felix Legions and loyal servant to

the true emperor, Marcus Aurelius. Father to a murdered son.
Husband to a murdered wife. And | will have my vengeance, in this life
or the next.
